        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a self-motivated individual, always eager to learn and expand my knowledge. My experience in customer service and technical environments has polished my communication skills. I quickly learn and adopt new technologies in fast-paced settings. In my free time, I enjoy working with virtual machines and using the terminal. Proficient in software tools and systems such as MS Office and Linux, I continuously seek ways to improve my technical skills. Enthusiastic about IT and system administration, I am always willing to provide comprehensive support for IT systems. My long-term goal is to specialize in network infrastructure and cloud computing, with a hands-on approach to technology.</p>
